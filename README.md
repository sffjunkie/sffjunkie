- Amateur developer with years and years of experience (so that's 2 years at least)
- Open sauce advocate (Tommy K is a favourite)
- Hardware maintenance a speciality (I once instaled 32K of RAM in a ZX Spectrum)
- Currently looking for help with winning the lottery.
- Created a project with downloads in the top 1% of PyPi ('They' say it's only because it's a direct dependency of another very popular project and they're definitely right (because they include me))
- Currently learning (always have done, always will do)
